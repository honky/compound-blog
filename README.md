### Welcome to the MVC+H Website ###

This is a project nearly every Webdeveloper does from time to time - writing a blog or cms from scratch using the programming language he or she wants to learn. So do I, and I invite everybody to take part in this compound js, bootstrap 3 thing.

To install and run it yourself:

1. run  ```git clone```
2. run  ```cd compound-blog```
3. run  ```npm install -l```
4. run  ```compound seed```
	this seeds the db with sample users
5. run node server.js or use compounds console ```npm install compound -g``` and use ```compound server 8888```
6. open a browser ```localhost:8888``` and use  ```user``` and  ```password``` as credentials to login the system
7. change the credentials!
8. ???
9. Profit!
